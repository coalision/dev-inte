# dev-inte
## TEST

Try to integrate this static page (without the dynamic features), respecting as much as possible:
- SEO
- Accessibility (WCAG)
- Animations (eg: small animations when hovering a button).
- Performances (load time, weight)
- Bonus: i18n, header, footer

Focusing on the user experience, this integration must reflect your ability to offer rich pages while respecting the proposed designs and code quality !

Duration : appox 2h.
