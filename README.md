# dev-inte

## TEST

Try to integrate this static page (without the dynamic features), respecting as much as possible:
- SEO
- Accessibility (WCAG)
- Animations (eg: small animations when hovering a button).
- Performances (load time, weight)
- Header, footer not concerned.
- Bonus: i18n

Focusing on the user experience, this integration must reflect your ability to offer rich pages while respecting the proposed designs !
